# The-Wizards-Council

 Tier 1 — MVP Application - CRUD and REST

* `As a User, I want to read entries from the database `
* `As a User, I want to add entries to the database` 
* `As a User, I want to delete entries from the database` 
* `As a User, I want to edit entries in the database`
* `As a User, I expect to do all of the above by accessing RESTful routes`
* `As a User, I want to log in to a deployed app. Reference the Deployment section for instructions.`

# Tier 2 - Login, Hashing
* `As a User, I want to be able to log in to my API`
* `As a User, I want any passwords saved to be hashed and salted before saved to the database (note: If you use OAuth, you might not even store passwords at all!)`

# Tier 3 - Register
* As a potential User, I want to be able to sign up for the API
* As a signed-up User, I want to be granted authorization to access the API

# Tier 4 - Authorization

* As a User, I want my API protected from unauthorized Users
* As an unauthorized User, I want a helpful message telling me I do not have access to the API
* (optional, but recommended): As a user, I want to receive a helpful error message anytime there is a problem with the request (i.e. error handling middleware)
* As a User, I expect not to be able to create new entities without first logging in / authenticating in some way (token/session)
* As a User, I want my data to only be accessible by myself
* As a User, I want my data to only be editable/deletable by myself

# Tier 5 - Associated Data

In addition to the Tier 1 MVP criteria…
As a User, I want to be able to read a single entry
As a User requesting a single entry, I want to see the associated user info and other associated data. For example, if your API is a concert, instead If just the concert, I want to see who created the concert entry, as well as the associated location data, artist info, and attendees coming to the event.

# Tier 6 - Admin vs User

As an Admin, I want to have a special super-user account type that allows access to content Users don’t have access to
As a basic User, when requesting a list of all entries, I expect to only see my own entries (not entries of other users)
As an Admin, when requesting a list of all entries, I expect to be able to see all entries, regardless of user/owner
As an Admin, I want to be able to edit other users’ information via the API
As an Admin, I want to be able to delete or edit any entity, regardless of user/owner

# Bonus Goals

If your team completes all of the above, you could move to any of the following. They can be completed in any order, though we have roughly ordered them by difficulty level. Feel free to go out of order, but they do get harder as you go down the list!

# Bonus Goal 1: Front End Login

As a User, I want to be able to use a client-side form to Log in/out of my application.
As a User, I want to be able to sign up using a client-side form.
This could be via a traditional web form, or more preferably, with a React app.

# Bonus Goal 2: Seed

As a Developer cloning the repo for the first time, I want to be able to run a seed command and have the database populated with data.
As a Developer, I want multiple users to be seeded to the database

# Bonus Goal 3: Testing

As a Developer, I want to be able to run a test commend (such as npm test or the command specific to your technology/project) and have all my tests run.
As a Developer, I want to know if my new code has broken anything (passing tests means it theoretically didn’t)

# Bonus Goal 4: Continuous Integration

As a Developer, I want the tests to run each time I open a PR to the main branch. 
As a Developer, I want failing tests to block a merge to main
Note: GitHub Actions or TravisCI are each great options for this.

# Bonus Goal 5: Pagination

As a Developer, I want to see many (Hundreds? Thousands?) entries seeded to use in testing. (Use an external package like faker to generate the data)
As a User requesting all entries, I want to receive paginated data (10 results instead of 5K)
As a User requesting all entries, I want to be able to request the next “page” or set of data
As a User requesting all entries, I want to be able to edit the page size (10 results at a time vs 50 or other amount)

# Bonus Goal 6: External API Automation

You could integrate external API for cool and fun functionality.  Feel free to let your imagination soar!  But here are a couple examples:
Intermediate - As a User signing up, I want to receive an email confirmation upon registration.  Use something like SendGrid - (100 free emails per day)
Advanced - As an Admin, I want to receive a daily email report with data about my entities (inventory value, daily throughput, etc).  I expect the report to come in at the same time every day.  You could achieve this by creating an interval-based Cron Job, running on a serverless host like Google Cloud or AWS Lambda.

# Bonus Goal 7: Front End Application

Heads-up, this is a big one!
Beyond just login…
As a User, I want to access, create, edit, and delete my data all from a front-end GUI application.
As a returning user, I want to be automatically logged in, instead of having to enter my credentials each time I revisit the application.
As a User, I want my app to be visually stunning
